/**
 * AppServiceContainer is a service container that manages core services for the application.
 * 
 * It extends the `TypedServiceContainer` class and registers essential services like `console`, 
 * `ytdlp`, and `queue` with their respective factories. It also provides named getters for easy access
 * to the registered services.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Registers core services using `registerCoreServices`.
 * - Provides named getters for each service (`consoleService`, `ytdlpService`, `queueService`).
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * const container = new AppServiceContainer();
 * container.registerCoreServices(getWindow);  // register core services
 * 
 * const consoleService = container.consoleService;  // access the console service
 * const ytdlpService = container.ytdlpService;    // access the ytdlp service
 * const queueService = container.queueService;    // access the queue service
